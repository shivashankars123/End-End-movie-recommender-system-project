Used TMDb datasets to collect movie data.
Processed the data to remove inconsistencies and extract meaningful features.
Model Building:
Utilized CountVectorizer and cosine similarity for feature extraction and recommendation logic.
Recommendation Function:
Developed an efficient function to recommend movies based on user input.
Frontend Development:
Built an interactive web interface using Streamlit for seamless user interaction.
Deployment:
Prepared the system for deployment on cloud platforms for accessibility.
Key Features
Considers genres, cast, crew, and keywords for comprehensive recommendations.
Real-time movie poster retrieval using the TMDb API.
Intuitive user interface for enhanced usability.
Challenges Faced
Data Cleaning: Addressed missing and inconsistent data structures.
